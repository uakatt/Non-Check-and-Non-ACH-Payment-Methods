Non-Check and Non-ACH Payment Methods
======================

This git repository represents the University of Arizona (the UA)'s _Non-Check and Non-ACH Payment Methods_ modification to **KFS 3.0**, in the form of patch files (generated by svn diff), liquibase scripts, and documentation.
This "patch package" is designed to be informative to technical developers in the position to
apply patch files to the java source code of KFS. In order to better serve such an endeavor,
this README contains several informative sections:

* <a href="#jiras">List of Jiras</a> - This list contains every Jira ticket at the University of Arizona
  that relates to this modification. It provides reverse documentation back to the developers at
  the UA in case of questions regarding how this patch package was created.
* <a href="#liquibase_changesets">List of Liquibase Changesets</a> - This list contains any
  liquibase changeset files that were associated with this modification.
* <a href="#patch_files">List of Patch Files</a> - This is a list of each patch file that needs
  to be applied to the KFS source code in order to realize the modification. This list does _not_
  include patch files for revisions that didn't touch the `trunk/` at the UA.
  Before a modification was merged with `trunk/`, it may have been tweaked, reworked, refactored,
  code reviewed, etc, in handfuls of revisions in a feature branch.
* <a href="#revisions">List of Revisions</a> - This list contains every revision associated with
  this modification. Many of which, as you will see, only touch files in a feature branch. The
  revisions that actually made it into the actual modification touch files in `trunk/`. The list
  of patch files is a better reference of which are these revisions.
* <a href="#files">Lists of Files</a> - These lists contain every file that was created,
  modified, or deleted for this enhancement.
* <a href="#post_mod_changes">List of Post-Modification Changes</a> - This list contains
  revision numbers that are _not_ included in the patches, or raw patches, but that touched one
  or more key files involved in this modification.

Disclaimer
==========

> This enhancement required numerous database changes that were developed over many months. In the end, the remaining developers at UA are not entirely certain what database changes were necessary specifically for this enhancement. Many changes were backed out, column names were changed, and some changes appear to insert UA-specific data. In the end, the liqubiase scripts included in this patch are likely unhelpful. So the developers at UA that built this patch package decided to do their best in writing one caconical SQL file that includes all of the changes needed for this enhancement. This single SQL file has not been tested or verified, so please verify the database changes upon implementation. Please provide any feedback to the UA team (or as an issue to this GitHub project) so that we may improve this SQL file if needed. Also, the SQL file has been converted from a Liquibase script, so there are references to DATABASECGANGELOCK and DATABASECHANGELOG tables that can be ignored if not using Liquibase.

<h2><a name="patch_files">Patch Files</a></h2>

This is a list of all of the patches for revisions that affected files in `trunk/`. The filenames in each has been modified, for easy digestion. UA's subversion server manages many Kuali projects in one Subversion project, so a file path like:

```

has been modified to:

<h2><a name="revisions">Revisions</a></h2>

This is an ordered list of revisions that relate to this modification. There may not be a patch
file for every revision listed below for the following reasons:

* A revision might only affect a branch, perhaps one where development primarily took place. Any
  changes that finally made it into `trunk/` will be seen in revisions that specifically touch
  files in `trunk/`. Therefore, we do not create patch files for revisions that only affect a
  branch.
* A revision might only include a liquibase changeset that is executed by some automated process.
  Since each institution maintains different revision controls on their database, liquibase
  changesets are not provided as patches. They are instead presented as intact files under the
  `liquibase-changesets/` directory.

[Here](Non-Check-and-Non-ACH-Payment-Methods/blob/master/patch_log.txt) is a printout of `svn log -v` for each revision.
